## Overview
Deep Learning models in the domains of language (LLMs) and vision (autonomous driving) are at the forefront of the contemporary technological advancements. Multimodal problems, which require simultaneous learning from both domains, pose significant challenges. An exemplary problem in this area is determining whether a meme is benign or hateful, a task highlighted by Facebook's <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/hateful-memes-challenge-and-data-set/">Hateful Memes Challenge</a>. This discussion explores a multimodal approach to solving this problem and presents the associated results.
