* LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/poonam-dongare/">poonamdongare</a><br><br>

**Education:**
* Master of Science in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/graduate-computer-science-programs-climb-latest-national-rankings">Georgia Tech</a></b> with a specialization in Machine Learning.
* Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://www.mtu.edu/">Michigan Tech</a>.<br><br>

**Work Experience:**
* Technical Specialist at <a href="https://www.cummins.com/">Cummins Inc</a>

**Machine Learning Experience:**
* Data Collection and Analysis: Gathered extensive time-series datasets from the Electronic Control Module (ECM) on semi-truck fleets.
* Predictive Maintenance: Analyzed time-series data to detect and predict hardware and software failures, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing downtime.
* Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing: Processed and engineered features from raw data to improve model performance. Applied techniques for cleaning and preparing the data, including handling missing values and normalizing data.
* Model Training with ML/DL Frameworks: Utilized the collected data to train machine learning (ML) for short-term forecast and deep learning (DL) models for long-term forecasts. For example, used scikit-learn for logistic regression and decision tree models for short-term predictions, and PyTorch for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for long-term forecasting.
* Model Evaluation and Validation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Implemented cross-validation techniques to ensure robust model performance.
* Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models and performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search and random search to improve model accuracy.
* Simulation and Modeling: Developed ML models of the system using scikit-learn and PyTorch for running simulations. Enhanced understanding and forecasting of system behavior under various conditions, such as simulating temperature and pressure impacts on system performance.
* Collaboration and Communication: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate models into existing systems and presented findings and insights to stakeholders.
* Tools and Technologies: Proficient in using tools and libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
* Deployment and Monitoring: Deployed models to production environments and monitored their performance over time, ensuring they meet the required accuracy and efficiency standards.
